Base64 Encode
=============

`base64-encode` is a simple xxd replacement to convert files
into embeddable C++ source code. Instead of using binary array
it used base64 strings, which makes it much more performant 
for large files. Currently only -i option is supported for 
compatibility. More options to be released in future. C++ 98 compliant.

### Usage
```bash
base64-encode -i file.in out.cpp
```
```
Options:
  -h        Help
  -v        Show version information
  -i        Convert input file to C++ source
```

### Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
